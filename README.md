# Riot Takehome Task Specification

Your task is to implement a REST API which:

1. Has two endpoints `/encrypt` and `/decrypt`. Each endpoint should take
a JSON payload.
2. Use **Base64** to implement encryption and decryption on the
`/encrypt` and `/decrypt` endpoints respectively.
   - `/encrypt` should encrypt every value in the object (at a depth of 1), returning the encrypted payload as JSON.
   - `/decrypt` should detect encrypted strings and decrypt them, returning the decrypted payload as JSON.

   For example:
   ```JSON
   {
     "foo": "foobar",
     "bar": {
       "isBar": true
     }
   }
   ```
   would become
   ```JSON
   {
     "foo": "some_encrypted_string",
     "bar": "some_encrypted_string"
   }
   ```
3. The **Base64** encryption algorithm should be easily replaceable with another algorithm without requiring significant changes to the codebase.
4. Create a `/sign` endpoint which takes a JSON payload and computes a
cryptographic signature for the plaintext payload in HMAC. The signature is then
sent in a JSON response.
5. Create a `/verify` endpoint, which takes a JSON payload of the form
```js
{
   "signature": "<COMPUTED_SIGNATURE>",
   "data": {
      // ...
   }
}
```
- Data can be any JSON object and can contain encrypted fields.
- If the provided signature matches the computed signature, the response code should be `204`; otherwise, it should be `400`.
